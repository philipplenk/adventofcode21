This respository contains my solutions for [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021).

Unlike [last year](https://github.com/philipplenk/adventofcode20), I was especially lazy this time and wrote no additional explanations at all. Aside from some minor cleanup and removal of self-insulting comments produced in the heat of the moment, the code is kept in pretty much its original form, exactly as it was written at 6 am in a severly sleep deprived state. As such it is far from ideal and none of it should be considered a good example for anything ;-)
